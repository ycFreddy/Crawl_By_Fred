Summarization required 60k human labels; simpler tasks which continue text in various styles required only 5k. Our motivation is to move safety techniques closer to the general task of âmachines talking to humans,â which we believe is key to extracting information about humanÂ values.</td>

Our analysis shows that industry cooperation on safety will be instrumental in ensuring that AI systems are safe and beneficial, but competitive pressures could lead to a collective action problem, potentially causing AI companies to under-invest in safety. We hope these strategies will encourage greater cooperation on the safe development of AI and lead to better global outcomes ofÂ AI.</td>

Our analysis shows that industry cooperation on safety will be instrumental in ensuring that AI systems are safe and beneficial, but competitive pressures could lead to a collective action problem, potentially causing AI companies to under-invest in safety. We hope these strategies will encourage greater cooperation on the safe development of AI and lead to better global outcomes ofÂ AI.</td>

Our analysis shows that industry cooperation on safety will be instrumental in ensuring that AI systems are safe and beneficial, but competitive pressures could lead to a collective action problem, potentially causing AI companies to under-invest in safety. We hope these strategies will encourage greater cooperation on the safe development of AI and lead to better global outcomes ofÂ AI.</td>

Supervised deep learning systems can only be as good as their training datasets, but in self-play systems, the available data improves automatically as the agent gets better.</td>

The neural networks are trained entirely in simulation, using the same reinforcement learning code asÂ OpenAI FiveÂ paired with a new technique called Automatic Domain Randomization (ADR). The system can handle situations it never saw during training, such as being prodded by aÂ stuffed giraffe. This shows that reinforcement learning isnât just a tool for virtual tasks, but can solve physical-world problems requiring unprecedented dexterity.</td>

      <td>OpenAI Five is the first AI to beat the world champions in an esports game, having won two back-to-back games versus the world champion Dota 2 team,Â OG, atÂ FinalsÂ this weekend. Both OpenAI Five and DeepMindâs AlphaStar had previously beaten good pros privately but lost their live pro matches, making this also the first time an AI has beaten esports pros onÂ livestream.</td>

Specifically, for summarization tasks the labelers preferred sentences copied wholesale from the input (weâd only asked them to ensure accuracy), so our models learned to copy. Summarization required 60k human labels; simpler tasks which continue text in various styles required only 5k. Our motivation is to move safety techniques closer to the general task of âmachines talking to humans,â which we believe is key to extracting information about humanÂ values.</td>
